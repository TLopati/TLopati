Junior Full Stack Developer

Hi, I'm Teancum Lopati, a passionate Junior Full Stack Developer with experience in JavaScript, CSS, MongoDB, and React. My favorite project so far has been Mission 5, where I overcame numerous challenges to deliver a final product that matched our original vision and design.

Outside of coding, I’m an avid sports enthusiast—playing everything from indoor netball to American football. I’m also a gamer and occasionally stream my gameplay online.
